## CS453 Spring 2024 Project Report

Please use this GitHub Classroom repo to submit the project reports. You are expected to submit the following two files using this repository.

### A group report

You should submit a report written collectively by the team about your project. Note that each person should submit the group report of their team, not just a representative. The group report should clearly describe the following:

- The problem being tackled by the project
- The suggested solution
- How you evaluated the suggested solution
- The evaluation results
- A link to the group project GitHub repository

The group report should contain a list of team members: names and student ID numbers.

### An individual report

In addition to the group report, each individual should submit an individual report. It should contain the following:

- Detailed description of your own contribution to the project
- Your assessment of your team members: use a 0-10 grade scale, with a brief justification for the grade you gave to each member

The individual report should contain your name and student ID number.
